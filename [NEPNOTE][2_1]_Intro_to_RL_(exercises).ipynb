        "This leads to strange behavior, as we can't meaningfully compare the returns for sequences of rewards that diverge. Trying to sum the sequence $1,1,1,\\ldots$ or $2,2,2,2\\ldots$ or even $2, -1, 2 , -1, \\ldots$ is a problem since they all diverge to positive infinity. An agent with a policy that leads to infinite expected return might become lazy, as waiting around doing nothing for a thousand years, and then actually optimally leads to the same return (infinite) as playing optimal from the first time step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Worse still, we can have reward sequences for which the sum may never approach any finite value, nor diverge to $\\pm \\infty$ (like summing $-1, 1, -1 ,1 , \\ldots$).\n",
        "We could otherwise patch this by requiring that the agent has a finite number of interactions with the environment (this is often true, and is called an **episodic** environment that we will see later) or restrict ourselves to environments for which the expected return for the optimal policy is finite, but these can often be undesirable constraints to place.\n",

The geometric discount $\\Gamma(i) = \\gamma^i$ is commonly used, but other discounts include the hyperbolic discount $\\Gamma(i) = \\frac{1}{1 + iD}$, where $D>0$ is a hyperparameter. (Humans are [often said](https://chris-said.io/2018/02/04/hyperbolic-discounting/) to act as if they use a hyperbolic discount.) Other than  being mathematically convenient to work with (as the sum of geometric discounts has an elegant closed form expression $\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\gamma^i  = \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$), geometric is preferred as it is *time consistent*, that is, the discount from one time step to the next remains constant.\n",

If after $N$ actions the agent ends up in exactly the same state as it was in before, then there will be less total value remaining (because of the decay rate), but the optimal policy won't change (because the rewards the agent gets if it takes a series of actions will just be a scaled-down version of the rewards it would have gotten for those actions $N$ steps ago)."
